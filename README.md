# GreenðŸŒ¿Thumb

## Concept:
Explain the concept of the application or game. Include instructions and how to win/lose.

GreenThumb is a game to practice your gardening skills. You sign up with an email (going to try including a summary email that populates if you win or lose) and are prompted to pick a plant type corresponding to either easy(beginner) or less easy(advanced). Once a level is chosen you assign a name to your plant choice. The plant choice, name and age will display in the play mode screen. You will manage the parameters of THIRST, LONELINESS & IMPENDING DOG ATTACK. If you can keep your plant alive for 7 days (7 minutes) you win! If your plan succumbs to mis-managed parameters, you lose!

# GreenðŸŒ¿Thumb

## Concept:
GreenThumb is a game for flexing your plant nurturing skills. 

Can YOU keep your plant alive for 10 days to win the game? 

You begin by naming your new plant and following 3 simple rules.

1. Water your plant when it's thirsty.
2. Talk to your plant when it's lonely.
3. Walk to dog so it won't bother your plant.

When your plant tells you what it needs, or a status bar turns red, click the corresponding button to dispel the threat to your plant. If your plant stays alive for 10 days, you win!

Win or lose, you can always play again.

## Technologies Used:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JQuery
    - JavaScript

## Approach:
I worked backwards from a previous project I really admired Tomagatchi-the-curse. I started by re-writing the html page line by line to filter through what I needed to apply to my game concept and adjusting text CSS and html tags. 

I had to rework the variable names throughout the JS and logic for the functions tied to the status bars. I wanted two status bars to be adding value and one to be decreasing. Thirst and Loneliness require higher rates of button pushing to dispel the threat. I was trying to reflect the sneakiness of dog attacks with the adjusted build rate of the dog attacks meter.   

I adjusted the bottom status bar to represent the age progression of the plant pet and to reflect the name choice. I also threaded the name choice through to the win/lose screens. I added the text counting up the days in age which triggers the win/lose logic. I also added the red alert color to all the status bars to indicate you're nearing a failed category.

I connected my images to the time trigger on the age status bar to reflect growth as time progresses. Added text comentary from the plant that is triggered by the level of each threat. Each threat triggers a text warning from the plant when it reaches a certain level. 

## Challenges:
All of it, in a good way. It was challenging to see how every small step in making things "happen" on a website game requires 10 smaller steps to execute in the code. It was challenging to see how one small change can break so many things.  

## Additional information:
It helped me a lot to start from something functional and work backwards, breaking each part so I could try and fix it the way I needed it to be. I did have help on the functions to check my logic and remove about 20% of each object that wasn't needed for my game use. I touched every part of the code, a lot of the existing CSS was just what I wanted so that aspect has the least changes.
